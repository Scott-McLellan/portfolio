        <p class="bio">Hello, my name is Scott Mclellan and this is my bio, I was born in Tustin Califonia on December 7 2004 to a Christian family that taught me all I know today. The sport that I grew up with was soccer, becoming a professional soccer player was one of my dreams going up, but that ship sunk in High School when I didn't make the cut for the team. I life was pretty normal I went to three schools all my life Peters Canyon Elementary School, Pioneer Middle School, and Beckman High School. Now I'm here at Concordia, loving it here, thanks for reading.</p>
